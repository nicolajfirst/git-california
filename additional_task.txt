### Amend a Commit
Let's try to use the git command in combining commits.

This task can take you about 0.5 hour to complete.

Please do the following:

- Create two additional commits in the update-readme branch.
- Use a git command to combine both commits into a single one.
- Share git log with mentor.

### Add a Cherry-Pick
Cherry-picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another. Let’s try your hand at practicing!

This task can take you about 1 hour to complete.

Please do the following:

- Create a new branch – cherry-pick-readme branch from update-readme. Switch to this branch. Add changes in the README.md file.
- Create a commit with a commit message `Cherry-pick readme`.
- Make sure to master and create a new branch from master - release.
- Use cherry-pick to pick commits from cherry-pick-readme to the release branch.
- Create a pull request release back to master and add your mentor as a reviewer.
